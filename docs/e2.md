## 6. Obtaining the State Vector \( x(t) \) and the System Response \( y(t) \)

Apply the general formula:
```math
 x(t) = \mathcal{L}^{-1} \left\{ (sI - A)^{-1} \right\} x(0) + \mathcal{L}^{-1} \left\{ (sI - A)^{-1} BU(s) \right\} 
```

$$ \[ y(t) = Cx(t) \] $$

with zero initial conditions and 

$$ \( u = \sin(t) \). $$

1. **Initialization and symbol definition**: We start by clearing the workspace and define the symbolic variables \( t \) and \( s \) that will be used to perform operations in the time and Laplace domain respectively.
2. **Definition of matrices and parameters**:
  - Matrix A, which defines the dynamics of the system.
  - Matrix B, which relates the input \( u(t) \) to the system.
  - Matrix C, which determines how the state variables are related to the output.

```math
A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & -1 \end{bmatrix} ; B = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} ; C = [1 \ 0] ; D = 0 
```

3. **We calculate and visualize the eigenvalues of A**: These values are essential since they provide information about the stability and behavior of the system.
4. **We derive the characteristic polynomial**: This is the equation that is obtained from the determinant of \( sI-A \).

5. **State space model and transfer function**: We convert our state space system to a transfer function.
5. **Application of the Laplace Transform on the input**: Since we work with \( u(t) = \sin(t) \), we take its Laplace Transform.

7. **We compute the homogeneous response of the system**: Since the initial conditions are zero, it can be computed directly with \( (sI-A)^{-1} \times x(0) \).
8. **We compute the particular response of the system**: With the given input and using the Inverse Laplace Transform, we compute the particular response \( xp(t) \).
9. **Determination of the total response**: Adding the homogeneous and particular responses, and applying the matrix C, we obtain \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \).

- **Conversion to anonymous functions**: We convert the symbolic responses \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \) to anonymous functions for more efficient and faster evaluation in MATLAB.
- **Graphing the answers**: We visualize the functions \( x1(t) \), \( x2(t) \), and \( y(t) \) in a specific time window.
- **Function saving**: We save these responses as `.m` functions for later use.

## Simulating the State Vector \( x(t) \) and the System Response \( y(t) \)

Simulate the state vector \( x(t) \) and the system response \( y(t) \) of point 6. Plot \( x1(t) \), \( x2(t) \), and \( y(t) \). Compare with the response of point 1.

To carry out the comparison, we will evaluate the system in Simulink and we will use the scope previously used for the previous steps, for that, we must:

- **Addition of the "Sine Wave" block**: This block will generate the signal \( u(t) = \sin(t) \) which will be the input of our system.
- **Addition of the block "MATLAB_FUNCTION" stateResponse**:
  - In this block, we define a function that calculates the state and system responses using the \( x1(t) \), \( x2(t) \), and \( y(t) \) functions that we saved previously. This block takes the input \( u(t) \) and returns the corresponding responses.
- **Connecting the blocks**: Connect the output of the "Sine Wave" block to the input of the "MATLAB_FUNCTION" block.
- **Adding a "Scope" block**: This block allows us to visualize and compare the outputs of our system.
- **Setting up and running the simulation**: Once everything is connected correctly, we can run the simulation and observe the system responses in the "Scope" block. These responses can be compared with those obtained in the first step to verify accuracy and consistency.

## 8.	Indicate if the system is controllable. Justify your answer.
To determine if the system is controllable, we perform an analysis using the system matrices:

- \( A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \)
- \( B = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \)
- \( C = [1 \quad 0] \)
- \( D = 0 \)

Controllability indicates if it is possible to take the system from any initial state to any final state in a finite time using a suitable control input.

##### Kalman Controllability Criterion:
The controllability matrix \( CK \) was calculated. It has full rank, equal to the dimension of the system (rank = 2), implying the system can reach any state using a suitable control input in a finite time.

**Result**: The system is controllable according to the Kalman criterion.

##### Hautus Controllability Criterion:
Considering the eigenvalues of matrix \( A \) which are \( -0.5+0.86603i \) and \( -0.5-0.86603i \), the matrix \( Hc \) maintains full rank (rank = 2).

**Result**: The system is controllable according to the Hautus criterion.

##### Controllability Gramian Criterion:
The Gramian of controllability has a determinant of \( 0.2500 \). Since it is non-zero, the system is controllable.

**Result**: The system is controllable according to the Controllability Gramian.

### Additionally:
- The eigenvalues of A showed that the system has complex conjugate dynamics. This implies a damped oscillation in the system response.
- The obtained transfer function represents the relationship between the input and output of the system.
- The response x(t) and y(t) of the system also support the controllability conclusion. The response shows exponentially decaying dynamics, which is consistent with the eigenvalues obtained. Furthermore, being able to model and obtain a specific response indicates that the system can be adequately influenced by a control input.

***Conclusion: Based on the above criteria and the results provided, we can state with certainty that the system is controllable. This means that it is possible to drive the system from any initial state to any final state in a finite time using a suitable control input.***

## 9.	Indicate if the system is stable. Justify your answer
To determine the stability of the system, we look at the eigenvalues of matrix \( A \). The system is asymptotically stable if all eigenvalues have negative real parts and are in the left half-plane of the complex plane.

![image](https://github.com/JoseEmmanuelVG/MechatronicSystemsControl/assets/89156254/5fd31463-ac28-4993-9f5b-6b0c3f481353)



It is observed that both eigenvalues have negative real parts (-0.5000), indicating that they are located in the left half-plane of the complex plane. The presence of an imaginary part means that the system response will exhibit oscillatory behavior, but the negative real part ensures that this oscillatory behavior will decay exponentially with time.

This is also supported by the system response x(t) and y(t). The responses contain exponential terms of the type e^(-t/2), indicating exponential decay. In addition, the cosine term present is due to the imaginary part of the eigenvalues, indicating the oscillatory behavior mentioned above.

The characteristic polynomial, sÂ²+s+1, also confirms the eigenvalues obtained, and its analysis leads us to the same conclusion.

***Conclusion: Based on the location of the eigenvalues and the time responses provided, we can state that the system is asymptotically stable. The dynamics of the system decays exponentially with time, which means that any initial perturbation or input to the system will eventually attenuate, and the system will return to an equilibrium state.***

## General Conclusion
The technical exploration of the system included:

6. **Obtaining the state vector \(x(t)\) and system response \(y(t)\)**:
   The time responses showed exponential decay with an oscillatory component, consistent with the system's eigenvalues.

7. **Simulation of the state vector \(x(t)\) and response \(y(t)\)**:
   By comparing \(x_1(t)\), \(x_2(t)\), and \(y(t)\) with initial results, we confirmed the consistency of the state-space and mathematical model responses.

8. **Evaluation of system controllability**:
   Using the Kalman criterion, Hautus criterion, and Controllability Gramian, we concluded the system is controllable.

9. **Evaluation of system stability**:
   The eigenvalues of matrix \( A \) and the characteristic polynomial \( s^2 + s + 1 \) confirm the system is asymptotically stable. Stability ensures the system behaves predictably without unwanted oscillations or unbounded growth.

The state space approach provided a detailed understanding of the system's behavior, verifying controllability and stability, essential for engineering analysis and design. The consistency of results across different methods underscores the robustness of state-space modeling in dynamic system analysis.
