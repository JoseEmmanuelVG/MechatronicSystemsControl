## 1. Simulate the circuit in Figure 1, input `u = sin(t)` is a current source, `y` is the voltage across the capacitor, with zero initial conditions. Plot `y(t)`.

### Current Source Configuration `u(t)`.

- The current source represents the input to the circuit and is modeled as a sinusoidal signal `u(t)=sen(t)`.
- **Sine Wave" block in Simulink:** Amplitude: 1 (this represents the current source).
  - Amplitude: 1 (this represents the maximum value of the current).
  - Frequency: 1 Hz (this defines the oscillation frequency of the signal).
  - Phase angle: 0 degrees (this indicates no initial phase shift).

### Simscape Electrical components

- **Resistor R1 and R2:**
  - Both resistors are set to a value of 1 Ω.
  - They are used to model the electrical resistance in the circuit.
- **Capacitors C1 and C2:** Both capacitors have a capacitance of 1 Ω.
  - Both capacitors have a capacitance of 1 F.
  - They store energy in the circuit and release the energy when needed.
- **Coil L:**  Coil L is set to a value of 1 F.
  - It is configured with a value of 1 H.
  - It represents the inductance in the circuit and opposes any change in current.

### System Configuration

- **PS-Simulink Conversion Blocks and vice versa:** These blocks are used to convert physical signals to standard Simulink signals and vice versa, allowing the integration of the Simscape environment with standard Simulink blocks.
- **Scope" block:**  Used to display the resulting signal.
  - Used to display the resulting signal `y(t)`, i.e. the voltage at C2.
- **Solver Configuration" block:** Essential for defining the solver characteristics.
  - It is essential to define the characteristics of the solver used for the simulation in Simscape. It ensures that the calculations are accurate and stable.

### Kirchhoff's Law for Currents (LIK)

$$ u = I_L + i_{RL} $$

```math
* u: source current. 
* I_L: current in the coil. 
* i_{RL}: current in the resistor which is in series with the coil.
```

$$ i_c = C \frac{dy}{dt} = \dot{y} \quad \text{(due to the relationship } V = \frac{1}{C} \int i_c \, dt) $$

```math
* I_c: current in the capacitor.
* C: capacitance of the capacitor (1 F in this case).
* y: voltage across the capacitor.
* y ̇: derivative of y with respect to time.
```

$$ u = y + i_{RL} \rightarrow i_{RL} = u - \dot{y} $$

### Kirchhoff's Law for Voltages (LVK)

$$ V_R + V_L = y $$

```math
* V_R: voltage drop across the resistor.
* V_L: voltage drop across the coil.
```

$$ Ri_{RL} + L \frac{d}{dt}i_{RL} = y $$

This equation relates the voltage across the resistor and coil to the voltage across the capacitor. Replacing i_{RL} from the above equation we obtain:

$$ u - \dot{y} + \dot{u} - \ddot{y} = y $$

¨y ̈¨ is the second derivative of y with respect to time.

### Mathematical Model

$$ \ddot{y} + \dot{y} + y = \dot{u} + u $$


## 3. Simulate the model of point 2, with zero initial conditions and `u = sin(t)`. Plot `y(t)`, compare with the answer of point 1.

### Input `u(t)`

- The input signal for the system is a time-varying sine function. This signal is used to simulate an oscillatory input to the system.
- **Sine Wave** block: This block generates a sinusoidal signal with a predetermined frequency and amplitude, representing `u(t)`.
- **Derivative** block: It is used to derive the sinusoidal signal to obtain `u'`, which is the derivative of the input signal with respect to time.

### Mathematical Model

To solve and understand the dynamics of the system represented by the given differential equation, the system is decomposed into parts using Simulink blocks.

- **Integrator 1**: This block integrates the signal it receives at its input. Therefore, if it receives `y''`, its output will be `y'`.
- **Integrator 2**: It works in the same way as Integrator 1, integrating the signal `y'` to produce `y`.
- **Sum** block: essential for gathering and summing multiple signals entering the block. In this case, it is used to implement the equation `y'' = u' + u - y' - y`:
  - Input 1: Takes `u'(t)` from the "Derivative" block.
  - Input 2: Takes `u(t)` directly from the "Sine Wave" block.
  - Input 3: Takes the output of "Integrator 1" (which is `y'`) and inverts it by means of a "Gain" block with a factor of -1. Or by applying (-) in the adder, as was the case.
  - Input 4: Takes the output of "Integrator 2" (which is `y`) and inverts it in the same way.
  - Output: This output is connected to Integrator 1 to continue with the simulation.

### Output and Display

- **Scope** block: this block is used to display the resulting signal `y(t)` of the system. It is connected to the output of "Integrator 2", allowing the observation of the system response over time and comparing it with point 1.

## 4.	Obtain the state space representation, of the form:

Obtain the state space representation of the form:
```math
* x' = Ax + Bu
* y = Cx + Du
```

**We start from the equation:**

$$ y'' + y' + y = u' + u $$

The state variables are defined as follows:

```math
1.- x1 = y + β0 u
2.- x2 = y + β0 u + β1 u = x1' + β1 u
```

Therefore:

$$ x1' = x2 - β1 u $$ 
$$ x2' = y'' + β0 u'' + β1 u' $$ 
$$  y' = x2 - β1 u' - β1 u $$ 


From our equations, substituting the state variables:

$$  x2' = -y' - y + u' + u + β0 u'' + β1 u' $$  

$$  x2' = -x2 + β0 u' + β1 u - x1 + β0 u + u' + u + β0 u'' + β1 u' $$  

$$  x2' = -x1 - x2 + (β0 + β1 + 1)u + (β0 + β1 + 1)u' + β0 u'' $$  

→ β0 = 0  
β0 + β1 + 1 = 0  
β1 = -1  
x2' = x1 - x2

The matrix representation of this would be:

[x1'
x2'] = [ 0 1
-1 -1 ] [ x1
x2 ] + [ 1
0 ] u' + [ 1
0 ] u


This agrees with what we have deduced above.
For the output, `y = x1`, we have:

y = [1 0] [ x1
x2 ]


Where:

- A = [ 0 1
        -1 -1 ]
- B = [ 1
        0 ]
- C = [ 1 0 ]
- D = 0

In case of including the input `u` and its derivative, then the matrix B becomes a 2x1 matrix and `u` must be considered as a vector containing the input and its derivative.

## 5.	Simulate the system of point 4, with zero initial conditions and u = sin(t). Plot x1(t), x2(t) and y(t). Compare with the answer of point 1

This Simulink model uses a state-space approach to simulate a dynamic system. The MATLAB Function block computes the derivative of the state and output at each time step based on the input and current state, while the integrator updates the state for the next time step. This type of model is powerful for designing and analyzing control systems, as it allows a concise representation of complex systems and can handle multiple inputs and outputs easily.

### Diagram Components

- **MATLAB Function (fcn) block**: This block is the heart of the controller. It defines the system dynamics using A, B, and C state-space matrices. Within this block, the derivative of the
