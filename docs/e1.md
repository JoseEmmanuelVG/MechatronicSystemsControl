# Mathematical model and state space

## Simulate the circuit in Figure 1, input `u = sin(t)` is a current source, `y` is the voltage across the capacitor, with zero initial conditions. Plot `y(t)`.

## Objective

To determine the voltage `y(t)` on a capacitor C2:

### Current Source Configuration `u(t)`.

- The current source represents the input to the circuit and is modeled as a sinusoidal signal `u(t)=sen(t)`.
- **Sine Wave" block in Simulink:** Amplitude: 1 (this represents the current source).
  - Amplitude: 1 (this represents the maximum value of the current).
  - Frequency: 1 Hz (this defines the oscillation frequency of the signal).
  - Phase angle: 0 degrees (this indicates no initial phase shift).

### Simscape Electrical components

- **Resistor R1 and R2:**
  - Both resistors are set to a value of 1 Ω.
  - They are used to model the electrical resistance in the circuit.
- **Capacitors C1 and C2:** Both capacitors have a capacitance of 1 Ω.
  - Both capacitors have a capacitance of 1 F.
  - They store energy in the circuit and release the energy when needed.
- **Coil L:**  Coil L is set to a value of 1 F.
  - It is configured with a value of 1 H.
  - It represents the inductance in the circuit and opposes any change in current.

### System Configuration

- **PS-Simulink Conversion Blocks and vice versa:** These blocks are used to convert physical signals to standard Simulink signals and vice versa, allowing the integration of the Simscape environment with standard Simulink blocks.
- **Scope" block:**  Used to display the resulting signal.
  - Used to display the resulting signal `y(t)`, i.e. the voltage at C2.
- **Solver Configuration" block:** Essential for defining the solver characteristics.
  - It is essential to define the characteristics of the solver used for the simulation in Simscape. It ensures that the calculations are accurate and stable.
